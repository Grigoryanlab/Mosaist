1. In fuser, initialize the structure not by averaging coordinates of supplied fragments (which assumes their prior superimposition in some relevant way), but by averaging internal coordinates from these fragments and then building a starting structure based on these averages. This would help in Jack's project, where he wants to achieve differential pivoting depending on the locally specified motifs. Do this as an option (i.e., leave averaging of coordinates as a possibility).
